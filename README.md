# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

_Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?_

**The Gaming Room is the client. "Draw It or Lose It" is a web-based game that was designed for Andorid. The goal was to expand the web-based game to other platforms that can play the game.**


_What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?_

**What I did particularly well was documenting and highlighting key areas of what the client was requesting. These key areas are the System Architecture, Domain Model, an Evaluation, and a recommendation as to which operating platform would be the best fit for the gaming application.** 


_What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?_

**What I found helpful was reviewing the UML diagram to see how the system architecture was built and how the application could be enhanced.**

_If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?_

**I would choose to revise the Evaluation and the Security section a little more. I still think what I have is good but the neccessary level of details to fullfil these two sections would be more involved to exact specifics. I would improve both sections by diving much deeper into how and why my findings for the system operating platform and security is better or worse based upon peer research findings. In addition, system platforms and security is always changing and evolving so this would be a continuous learning pattern**


_How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?_

**I interpreted the user's needs by understanding what was needed from a wider perspective in terms of gaming growth and how different platform usability would work in a system architecture. I believe having an application that's simple to use, build quality, aesthetics, speed and usabilty were the top most important needs as part of the software design. The user ultimately has total control over their own application. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing the application so that the product can withstand availabilty, security threats, memory and management, application maintenance and more. You want the game applcation to work and to allow modifcations if needed.**


_How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?_

**I approached the design at a long term goal. By using the IaaS by using a cloud service to secure, deploy and maintain our game was key to my goal. I wanted to build off of what we currently had and how we can make improvements to sustain long term usabilty. Implementing good research and documenting what's needed help to assess the next steps to building the software applcition we want. The key requirements are important to meet our technical standards to understand what we have and what we can do with it.**
